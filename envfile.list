# This is the environment list file. It contains a list of additional 
# environment scripts you wish to have executed (dotted/sourced) into
# your current environment. This file is parsed by the main environment
# file 'main.env'. 
# By convention, environment files have an extension of '.env'. this is
# NOT required but is usually the recommended naming method. As in one
# case below 'SystemType.sh' you may wish to not rename a file you 
# got from someone else. This is fine. Just add the file to this list 
# and it will be sourced into the environment that calls main.env.
